# Description

Add utils here, group them based on what they do or what they're working with (like browser.ts and math.ts).

./shadcn.ts contains shadcn/vue's utils, docs will ask you to insert some in there from time to time.
If you want to rename/move it - change ~/components.json config NOW, before installing any components.
If by that time you already installed some shadcn/vue components, you'll have to re-wire old imports via Ctrl+Shift+H or whatever.
